**Tinkering with:**

- ritual.sh - This website! I've been exploring the indieweb movement and working on this site to carve out my own little digital garden to tend. I'm having a lot of fun making art using pure CSS.
- After years of using Linux exclusively for servers, Microsoft's relentless [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) of Windows finally pushed me to migrate my actual workstations. Now running Linux on most machines (currently experimenting with Bazzite) and MacOS on the rest. Customising my desktop has been pretty fun.
