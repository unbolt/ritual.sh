One of the first presents we bought ourselves after we got married was a proper bean-to-cup coffee machine. For the longest time we just picked up whichever beans were cheap enough and easily available, be it from large online retailers or the local supermarket. We really needed to upgrade our coffee experience - here is my review of Rave Coffee.

More recently we decided we should be focusing on quality over quantity. Moreso we had become concerned over the [environmental impact](https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/consumption/foods-and-beverages/environmental-effects-of-coffee-production) our coffee habits were having. 

Deciding we could do better, we needed to find a local coffee supplier. They needed to also be environmentally minded.

A friend suggested we try Cirencester based [Rave Coffee](https://i.refs.cc/m9Xi83Rv?smile_ref=eyJzbWlsZV9zb3VyY2UiOiJzbWlsZV91aSIsInNtaWxlX21lZGl1bSI6IiIsInNtaWxlX2NhbXBhaWduIjoicmVmZXJyYWxfcHJvZ3JhbSIsInNtaWxlX2N1c3RvbWVyX2lkIjoxOTk0ODg5ODk5fQ%3D%3D). This is a brief review of the experience so far.

### The Coffee

Despite the photos in this post being of The Italian Job Blend, which is very nice in itself I am going to be talking about their _Now That's What I Call Coffee Nº 2023_ blend that is currently in our machine.

This coffee truly lives up to its name, offering a symphony of flavors that left us singing its praises. 

First and foremost, the aroma of this coffee is amazing. As soon as you open the bag, you're greeted with a rich and inviting fragrance that hints at the magic within. The beans are beautifully roasted to a 4/5 level, hitting that perfect balance between depth and brightness.

Rave describe this coffee as tasting of milk chocolate, blackberry and toffee. Whilst I am not amazing at detecting these subtle tastes in anything I did get the sense of the milk chocolate, creating a velvety and indulgent experience. It's a delightful taste that perfectly complements the robust coffee base.

One of my favourite things about this coffee is its ability to cater to a variety of tastes - my wife enjoys her coffee black, I have mine with milk or cream. All three have proved a great success with us. This blend is versatile enough to accommodate various brewing methods and preferences.

_Now That's What I Call Coffee Nº 2023_ is a must-try for anyone seeking a coffee that goes beyond the ordinary. With its captivating blend of milk chocolate, blackberry, and toffee, this coffee earns a well-deserved spot among our favorites.

### The Company

As I mentioned at the start, the coffee alone wasn't all we were looking for. We also wanted a coffee supplier that was in some alignment with our values.

Good news is, Rave Coffee seem quite environmentally minded. They are a member of [1% For The Planet](https://ravecoffee.co.uk/pages/1-for-the-planet)</a> - which donates 1% of sales (not profits) to environmental causes.

They're also not that far away from us geographically, so hopefully that cuts down on the carbon footprint a little bit.

Their website is really usable too. Sounds like a weird thing to say, but it's obscene how often a companies website seems to be actively trying to stop the user actually using it.

The price is probably 50% more than we were paying for coffee previously, but with our _quality not quantity_ mindset it's working out about the same on our monthly expenditure. They aren't cheap, but they are really good.

I don't have much more to say, the coffee we've had so far has been fantastic. Give it a go.

Before I sign off, can we just take a moment to appreciate how cool this pumpkin mug is?
