That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the post. I just wanted to post something on February 29th.



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
  <figure> 
  
  <div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
  </div></figure>
</div>



When I am undisputed ruler of the world, all February 29ths will be bank holidays. Decent ones too, like Christmas.
