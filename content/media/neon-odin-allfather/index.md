Neon Odin's _Allfather_ feels like mythology filtered through analog circuits and a CRT glow (much like myself). The album merges darksynth with handcrafted Nordic folk instruments - talharpa and nyckelharpa built by the artist himself - creating something that shouldn't work but absolutely does.

Tracks like "Wield The Hammer" and "March Of The Jǫtnar" pulse with vintage synthesizers while maintaining an almost ritualistic weight. There's a devotion here to both the Æsir and 80s electronics, and the combination taps into something primal about storytelling through sound.

This is retrowave that refuses to be purely nostalgic, grounding its neon-soaked atmosphere in actual craftsmanship and ancient narratives that really resonate.

Favourite Track: Wield The Hammer

Rating: 7/10
