Ninajirachi's _I Love My Computer_ captures something truthful about growing up shaped by screens and bandwidth. The album explores that strange intimacy we developed with our machines - the late nights, the secret discoveries, the way technology became less of a tool and more of a companion.

Tracks like "Fuck My Computer" and "iPod Touch" aren't just bangers; they're confessions about a relationship that transcends generations. Whether you learned HTML on Geocities or taught yourself production in GarageBand, there's recognition here.

The production has a restless energy, shifting between euphoric and introspective, mirroring how the internet itself feels—chaotic, isolating, and strangely beautiful all at once. It's a debut album that understands what it meant to have your world widened by a glowing rectangle - and I relate deeply to its content despite being at least one generation older than Ninajirachi.

Not my usual genre of listen, but it has been a regular spin since it came into my world.
