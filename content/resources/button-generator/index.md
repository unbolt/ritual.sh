Welcome to my 88x31 button creator, this is a pretty rough and ready implementation so it could be buggy, please let me know if you find any issues.

This supports gif despite the basic `canvas` tag limitation courtesy of [gif.js](https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.js) - none of this would be possible without that project.

Big thanks to [neonaut's 88x31 archive](https://neonaut.neocities.org/cyber/88x31) and everyone who made the buttons that appear there. You should check it out if you need inspiration for your button!

**Important note:** Some effects and animations stack, some don't. Some work better with certain lengths of text or variables depending on text length. Experiment, see what happens.
