Welcome to my 88x31 button creator, this is a pretty rough and ready implementation so it could be buggy, please let me know if you find any issues.

Currently this only supports static images and exports as png due to the basic `canvas` tag limitations. I have approximate plans for how to make this export gifs and potentially make animated buttons, please look forward to it.

Big thanks to [neonaut's 88x31 archive](https://neonaut.neocities.org/cyber/88x31) and everyone who made the buttons that appear there. You should check it out if you need inspiration for your button!
