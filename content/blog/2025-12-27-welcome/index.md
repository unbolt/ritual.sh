Welcome to my Bloggish! Here I am going to post weekly updates in the way of shortform notes, but without any strict rules on what I can and cannot include in them. There may be links, videos, photos etc.

There may well be other, non-weekly, updates and posts with larger topics covered. A few of the ideas I have for posts so far that I want to add:

- My hugo build and deploy script for Neocities
- Making random art things using HTML and CSS (see my lavalamp)
- How I synchronise my music library between many (many) devices

They'll come eventually.. Please look forward to it.
