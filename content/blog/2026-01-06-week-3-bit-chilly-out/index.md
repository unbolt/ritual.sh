- ❄️ It's been pretty cold and we've had the lightest sprinkling of snow.
- 📱 I did a mobile pass on some of the pages on this website, it works a bit better on phones now.
- 🟠 Added the [resources](/resources) section with a script to pull weekly last.fm stats (see example output below!)
- 🆒 Started working on an [88x31 button creator](/resources/button-generator/), it's got a decent amount of functionality so far.

## Links I Found Interesting

- [enclose.horse](https://enclose.horse/) - A daily game where you have to enclose a horse in the largest possible field.
