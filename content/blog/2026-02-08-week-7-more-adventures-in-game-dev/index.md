- 👾 Spent a decent amount of my spare time this week working on my next game, a cozy fishing game.
- 🎣 I’ve got a good number of the core mechanics in place, including:
  - The main fishing game
  - A day/night cycle and lunar cycle both impacting fish availability and their difficulty to catch
  - A weather system that also affects fish, and a weatherman who gives a 5 day forecast
  - A guild NPC who sells bait and rods, and buys fish. Certain things are only available at certain skill levels.
  - A guild contract system where you get 3 quests per day for bonus rewards - which quests you get might affect when and where you want to go fishing!
  - A separate quest system… this is in the early stages, but you can accept and complete quests from a log.
  - A fishing log that records quantity of fish caught, and your largest catch!
- ‼️ Holy heck that’s a lot of stuff, I’m really happy with the progress.
- 🖼️ I’ve been browsing itch.io assets and picked up a few I think fit the vibe well. I’ll add a few of my own once I’ve got a good handle on what I want.
- ✏️ I found my iPad pencil and drew a bunch of maps for the zones to be created.
- 📄 There’s a blog post coming, maybe tomorrow, about displaying my website stats on one of the Badgeware I received last week. I have 4 other draft posts I need to work on too!

## Next Week

I am going to push on with the cozy fishing game, there's a lot of colouring in to do but I am really looking forward to seeing people play this one. I'll need to work out how I am going to create a leaderboard for this one, too!
