- 🌊 I started the week not knowing much about Godot Shaders. I still don't know a lot but through mostly dumb luck I managed to produce a pretty cool (in my opinion) water shader for my fishing game. I'll do a full post about it soon.

- 🎂 It was my birthday on Monday, a quiet affair all in all but that is how I like it these days! We had cake.
- 😵‍💫 The absolute madlad over at tabf5 on neocities [made Tablings for every one of his 100 followers](https://tabf5.com/100). Absolute insanity. Mine is awesome (and clearly the best).
- 🐟️ I again spent most of my free time poking away at the fishing game, I did a [blog post about getting started](/blog/tiddler-dev-blog-1-making-a-plan/) and have many more planned I need to flesh out a bit.
- 🐢 I'm also well behind on updating things like my button wall and media log... I'll get back to that when I'm not hyperfocused on fish!
