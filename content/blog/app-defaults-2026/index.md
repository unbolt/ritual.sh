I've seen a lot of these popping up around the tech space and find them very interesting to see what tools and apps are peoples go-to for various every day things. Apparently there are [over 500 posts](https://defaults.rknight.me/) and counting! Here's mine right now:

- 📨 Mail Client - Proton Mail
- 📮 Mail Server - [Proton Mail](https://pr.tn/ref/MNB13JYX)
- 📝 Notes - Notes.app
- ✅ To-Do - Notes.app
- 📷 Phone Photo Shooting - Camera.app
- 🟦 Photo Management - Photos.app
- 📆 Calendar - Calendar.app
- 📁 Cloud File Storage - None
- 📖 RSS - [FreshRSS](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS)
- 🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts - Contacts.app
- 🌐 Browser - [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/)
- 💬 Chat - Discord
- 🔖 Bookmarks - Firefox Bookmarks Sync
- 📑 Read It Later - Notes.app
- 🧑‍💻 Code Editor - [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
- 🛒 Shopping Lists - Notes.app
- 📰 News - Avoid at all costs
- 🎵 Music - Tidal, [High Tide](https://github.com/Nokse22/high-tide), Turntable
- 🎤 Podcasts - Apple Podcasts
- 🔐 Password Management - Proton Pass

Apparently I dump a lot of stuff in the Notes app on my phone. It's the closest thing to hand and has almost zero barrier to entry. Also I know where all my stuff is then.

I should probably find better ways of organising things, but you know what they say - the best system is the one that works for you.
