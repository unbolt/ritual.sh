- 🎄 The family had a good Christmas, the kids enjoyed it and that's the main thing! We went to my parents for lunch, but the littlest one was without a nap so we were home by 3ish and he had an early night.
- 🎁 I got a Wiim Ultra for my bedroom headphone setup, I'll post more about it at some point.
- 🧑‍💻 I've been running Bazzite on my main desktop for a few weeks now and it's been a real joy to use. I haven't found anything I couldn't do on my windows machine.
- 🎮 We've been playing modded Minecraft again recently, on the Meatballcraft modpack. It's extremely complicated and we're barely a quarter of the way through it...

## Sneaky Sneaky

I've backdated this post a week to give myself a kick start. This post was actually written on 31/12/2025 thinking back to the previous week.

## Links I Found Interesting

- [Spotify Scraped](https://therecord.media/spotify-disables-scraping-annas) - I am all for digital preservation, but namechecking Spotify was probably a mistake.

## Music

iPod Touch by Ninajirachi has been going round and round in my head. Middlest child also loves it.

## Next Week

I've ordered a Thinkpad T480s to do some development on the go. So that'll be the next bit of excitement... I'm planning on installing some variation of Linux on it, but that might need its own post.

Until next week!
