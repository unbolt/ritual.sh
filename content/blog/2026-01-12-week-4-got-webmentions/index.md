- 🗨️ Added the ability to send and receive [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) to the blog.
- ✉️ Received an actual real life email from [Dan](https://danq.me/) to let me know he had sent the first one and it wasn't showing up, so I actually had to rush out the code to display webmentions, too!
- 🧰 Setup a little personal API to handle the guestbook, visitor counter, and aforementioned webmentions.
- 📺 Setup a dashboard on my homelab for monitoring all of the above.
- 🛜 Added an RSS feed for the blog. I've made my full posts available via RSS so you can consume them however you please.
- 💏 Made some significant progress towards our plans for moving house, and life in general!
- 🎁 Found some awesome little bits of tech and my wife kindly agreed to get them for my birthday next month, they will absolutely be showing up on the blog some time after that.
- 🧑‍💻 Wrote a script that can take a video with subtitles and a string of text, and return the gif of the clip. It'll be online shortly on GitHub and my resources section.
