- 🗨️ Added the ability to send and receive [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) to the blog. Haven't automated displaying of received ones yet, but I'll get there.
- 🧰 Setup a little personal API to handle the guestbook, visitor counter, and aforementioned webmentions.
- 📺 Setup a dashboard on my homelab for monitoring all of the above.
- 🛜 Added an RSS feed for the blog. Technically it already exists I just didn't have it in the meta tags. Or on the page. You can RSS now, that's the main thing.

## Links I Found Interesting

- [iCloud Photos Downloader](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader) and [Photos Backup Anywhere](https://photosbackup.app/) - Two useful looking things for backing up my Photos library

## Music
