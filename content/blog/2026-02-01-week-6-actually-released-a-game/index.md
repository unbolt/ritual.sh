- 🎮 I actually released a game! You can [play it right now](/games/whittler).
- ⚖️ During the finishing up stage I realised how hard balancing something like this is, there are over 7,000,000 skill unlock combinations. I wrote a simulator at one point but it was going to take a very very long time sim all the possible combinations.
- 👾 One of the most fun parts of making the game was right at the end where I decided I wanted to allow people to submit their high scores and display them, so got to explore Godot, the web export, and the javascript interactions.
- 🧑🏻‍💻 Some little gadgets arrived and I need to do a full blog post about them, it should be coming next week.
- 🦷 I lost my only filling so had to go to the dentist and get that sorted out.
- ❤️‍🩹 Slipped on our wet muddy patio last Sunday and hurt my knee which has been painful all week - overall a crap week, health-wise!
- ⚔️ I completed Final Fantasy VII: Remake, this time the PC version mostly played on the Steam Deck. Still don't have a good grasp on what the heck is going on with the fate elements, but overall it's a good game and a worthy remake.
