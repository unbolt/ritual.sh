- 🎆 Happy New Year! Last year went by shockingly fast, and the year ahead is looking very exciting too.
- 💻 The Thinkpad T480s arrived and has been suitably sticker bombed. I am running Pop!\_OS 24.04 on it and everything so far seems great.
- 🌐 I setup a dedicated server for this site and migrated off neocities, I am coming up with a plan on how to make sure updates keep getting posted there but redirect here.

## Links I Found Interesting

- [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) - I have killed off pretty much all social media, but I might look into posting more on Bluesky or setting up a Mastodon again, and this would be something to keep in mind.

Back to work properly tomorrow after the Christmas break and slow period, I imagine there'll be a lot coming my way.

Until next week!
