## What I've Been Working On

This week has been all about refining the blog system and adding some quality-of-life improvements to various projects.

### Blog System Overhaul

Finally got around to implementing the new blog content type with proper CRT terminal styling. The green phosphor aesthetic really brings that retro computing vibe I've been going for.

### Reading

Started "The Phoenix Project" - fascinating look at DevOps principles told through a narrative. Already applying some of the concepts to my personal workflow.

### Side Projects

- Cleaned up the home server rack cabling (again)
- Experimented with some new audio processing techniques
- Set up automated backups for all the important stuff

## Links I Found Interesting

- [Some Cool Article](#) - Fascinating deep dive into terminal emulation
- [Another Resource](#) - Great tips on managing dotfiles

## Next Week's Goals

Planning to dive deeper into Hugo's taxonomy system and maybe set up some automated deployment workflows. Also need to finally organize that cable mess behind the desk.

Until next week!
