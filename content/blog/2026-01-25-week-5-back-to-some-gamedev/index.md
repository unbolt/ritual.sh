- 🎮 Wrote the majority of a game engine for choose your own adventure style text based games. It has some useful feautres like sharing game states between multi-chapter games.
- 💭 Put a lot of thought and a bit of code towards the first game for this engine, it's called System Shutdown: 1999 and is based mostly in BBS forums.
- 🌧️ Had a ridiculous amount of rain this week, no flooding though thankfully.
- ✏️ [TabF5](https://tabf5.com/) sent me some stickers, and has also inspired me to do something similar in sending out stickers to those who request them and make a map of where I post to. I've started designing some stickers and doing some test prints.
- ⚔️ I started replaying Final Fantasy VII: Remake, on PC this time. I'm using the new "streamlined progression" (cheat) modes to skip most of the combat I have done before and focus on the story beats.
