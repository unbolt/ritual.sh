## This Week's Highlights

Another productive week! Got a lot done across various projects and discovered some great new music.

### Music Discovery

Found an incredible new album that's been on repeat all week. The production quality is phenomenal and it's perfect for late-night coding sessions. Added it to the rotation on the now playing section.

### Tech Experiments

Spent some time diving into terminal emulators (wrote a full post about it). Currently test-driving Alacritty and loving the performance boost from GPU acceleration.

### Home Lab Updates

- Upgraded the network switch firmware
- Reorganized the equipment rack (for the third time this month)
- Set up monitoring for all critical services
- Finally labeled all the cables

## Currently Reading

Still working through "The Phoenix Project" - the parallels to real-world IT operations are uncanny. Taking notes on bottlenecks and constraint theory.

## Random Thoughts

Why is cable management so satisfying yet so temporary? As soon as you get everything perfect, you need to add one more device and it all falls apart.

## For Next Week

- Write about my home server setup
- Explore some new static site generators
- Maybe finally tackle that Raspberry Pi cluster project I've been planning

That's all for this week. Stay curious!
