I love music. I'm working on trying to listen to things a bit more
attentively, so my plan is to write some thoughts about the various
albums I own, be it on cassette, vinyl, CD or digitally.

As I work through my collection they'll appear on the shelf, click on
them to see my thoughts.

Further down you can find a selection of the audio hardware I have,
eventually I want to get around to writing about these too!

If you have anything you think I'd like, or anything you have made -
please email it to me! dan@ritual.sh
